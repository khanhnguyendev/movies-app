# Getting Started

* Install Node.js if you haven't already from nodejs.org
* Download the script zip file from the section above
* Extract the zip then open your OS terminal in the new folder
* In your terminal run npm install to install dependencies, then run npm run dev to start the dev server
* Visit the dev server by going to http://localhost:5173 in a browser
* Run npm run build in the terminal to build the production files
* You will get the final site files in /dist which you can upload to your server
* You only need a static server to host this site, so you could use something like Netlify to host it for free.
